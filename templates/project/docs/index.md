# Dummy Project

## Getting started

This repository contains a dummy template for a "Project".

A typical setup organizes entities under an "Environment" --> "Cluster" --> "Project" hierarchy. This is a starting point to implement from scratch new templates of your own design.

Standard template for an empty project produced by scaffolding.
